Deployment Instructions
Render Deployment (Recommended)
This project is configured for easy deployment on Render with a free PostgreSQL database.

Prerequisites
Create a Render account (free tier is sufficient)
Push your DevQuest project code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
Option 1: Blueprint Deployment (Recommended)
This is the easiest method as it automatically configures both the web service and the PostgreSQL database.

Login to Render: Go to dashboard.render.com and log in

Create a New Blueprint:

Click "New" in the top right corner
Select "Blueprint"
Connect your Git provider if not already connected
Choose the repository containing your DevQuest code
Click "Apply Blueprint"
Render will automatically detect the render.yaml file and create all required services.

Option 2: Manual Deployment
If the blueprint method doesn't work, you can set up services manually:

Create a PostgreSQL Database:

Click "New" in the Render dashboard
Select "PostgreSQL"
Provide a name (e.g., "devquest-db")
Choose the Free plan
Click "Create Database"
Take note of the "Internal Database URL" for the next step
Create a Web Service:

Click "New" again and select "Web Service"
Connect your repository
Name your service (e.g., "devquest")
Set the Environment to "Node"
Set the Build Command to ./render-build.sh
Set the Start Command to npm start
Add the following environment variables:
DATABASE_URL: Use the Internal Database URL from the previous step
SESSION_SECRET: Generate a random string
NODE_ENV: production
Choose the Free plan
Click "Create Web Service"
Troubleshooting
Check the Render dashboard logs for any build or runtime errors
For more detailed troubleshooting, please refer to the RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md file.
